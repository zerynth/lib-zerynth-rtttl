*************
RTTTL Library
*************

This module contains class definitions for the “RTTTL” melody player to be used for driving buzzers or speakers connected to PWM pins.

The format of RTTTL notation is similar to the Music Macro Language found in BASIC implementations present on many early microcomputers. Various RTTTL melodies can be founded and downloaded `here <http://ez4mobile.com/nokiatone/rtttf.htm>`_ and many other websites.
